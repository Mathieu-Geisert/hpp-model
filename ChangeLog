hppModel 1.4 released Oct  8, 2008.

	 17. Fixed bug in CkitMat4MatrixFromAbstract()
	 16. Added ChppJoint::velocityBounds()
	 15. Fixed bug in ChppDevice::hppSetCurrentConfig(const vectorN&, EwitchPart)
	 14. Modifications to used fixed joints.

hppModel 1.3 released May 14, 2008.

	13. Fix version numbering error.

hppModel 1.1 released May 13, 2008.

        12. Added access functions to ChppJoints corresponding to feet,
            hand and gaze.

        11. If CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS are not defined at configuration, they
            are set to "-Wall".
        10. Added Anchor Joint for fixed joints.

hppModel 1.0 released February 18, 2008.

        9. Changed the class inheritance organization:
          9.1. ChppHumanoidRobot now virtually derives from
               CimplHumanoidDynamicRobot and is not anymore instanciated
               through the template mechanism,
          9.2. template <class HDR> ChppSpecificHumanoidRobot now derives
               from ChppHumanoidRobot and from HDR (optimized
               implementation of CimplHumanoidDynamicRobot).

           9.1 is required by 9.2 and 9.2 makes the optimal implementation
           compatible with ChppHumanoidRobot.

        8. Added a template class ChppSpecificHumanoidRobot to allow
           optimized implementation of humanoid dynamic model.

        7. In function ChppBody::addSolidComponent, the only KPP joint is
           retrieved
           from the body to attach the solid component.
           This modification makes hppModel compatible with hppCorbaServer.
        6. Added operator<< in classes ChppDevice and ChppJoint for
           debugging purposes.

        5. Reorganization of header files to solve some compilation problems.

        4. First version successfully tested with hppWalkPlanner.

        3. hppBody::getInnerObjects() removed (use innerObjects() instead)
           hppBody::getOuterObjects() removed (use outerObjects() instead)

        2. Reorganization of classes.
           1. ChppJoint does not derive anymore from CjrlJoint and CkwsJoint
           2. ChppJointFreeFlyer, ChppJointRotation and
              ChppJointTranslation have been removed.

        1. remove methods getOuterObjects, getOuterObjects and attributes
           inner, outer since they are implemented in CkwsKCDBody.
