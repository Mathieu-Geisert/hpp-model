/// \section sec_intro_hppDevice Introduction
///
/// This package is an extension of jrl-dynamics implementing
/// kinematic and dynamic computations for a kinematic chain.
/// jrl-dynamics implements
/// <a href="@ABSTRACT_ROBOT_DYNAMICS_DOXYGENDOCDIR@/index.html">robot
/// dynamics</a> abstract interfaces, while this package adds a
/// dependency to flexible collision library in order to handle
/// collision checking with a model of environment.
///
/// \section sec_hppDevice_organization_classes Organization of the classes
///
/// The position of robot links is handled by class hpp::model::Body
/// that contains fcl objects and that performs collision tests and
/// distance computations.
///
/// Objects of types hpp::model::Body are created by a local object factory.
