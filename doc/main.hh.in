\section sec_intro_hppDevice Introduction

This package contains classes representing robots, humanoid robots, joints and bodies with 
\li dynamic properties (mass, inertia, velocity, acceleration,...) that are implemented through <a href="@ABSTRACT_ROBOT_DYNAMICS_DOXYGENDOCDIR@/main.html">robot dynamics</a> abstract interfaces,
\li geometric properties (kinematic chain, distance to obstacles) that are implemented by <a href="@KINEOCONTROLLER_PREFIX@/share/doc/KPP SDK/html/main.html">KineoPathPlanner</a>.

\section sec_hppDevice_organization_classes Organization of the classes

\subsection subsec_hppDevice_robots Robots

The following figure displays the inheritance diagram between classes of KineoWorks and robot dynamics packages and implementation classes of robot dynamics classes. classes hpp::model::impl::DynamicRobot and hpp::model::impl::HumanoidDynamicRobot are implementations of respectively CjrlDynamicRobot and CjrlHumanoidDynamicRobot.

\subsubsection subsubsec_humanoid_optimized Optimized implementation of humanoid robot.

It is possible to instantiate an optimized implementation of a humanoid robot through a template mechanism explained in documentation of class hpp::model::SpecificHumanoidRobot.

\subsection subsec_hppDevice_joints Joints

The following figure displays the inheritance diagram between classes representing robot joints.
\li hpp::model::impl::Joint is an implementation of CjrlJoint,
\li hpp::model::impl::JointFreeflyer is an implementation of freeflyer joint deriving from hpp::model::impl::Joint,
\li hpp::model::impl::JointRotation is an implementation of rotation joint deriving from hpp::model::impl::Joint,
\li hpp::model::impl::JointTranslation is an implementation of translation joint deriving from hpp::model::impl::Joint.
