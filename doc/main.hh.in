/// \section sec_intro_hppDevice Introduction
///
/// This package implements forward kinematics for a kinematic chain.
/// The kinematic chain is a tree of hpp::model::Joint that belongs to a
/// hpp::model::Device.
///
/// The position of each joint depends on the current configuration of the
/// device.
///
/// A hpp::model::Body can be attached to each joint. hpp::model::Body carry
/// \li geometric hpp::model::CollisionObject that can collide each other,
/// \li mass and inertia.
///
/// A hpp::model::HumanoidRobot is a device with accessors to specific joints
/// like
/// \li left and right ankles,
/// \li left and right wrists,
/// \li gaze joint (that moves the cameras),
/// \li chest,
/// \li waist.
